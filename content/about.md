Hi! My name's Alessandro Minoccheri and I'm a software web developer for [StudioMado](https://www.studiomado.it/) living near Ravenna, Italy.  
I typically work with backend **PHP** and **Node.js** applications and I love to contribute to open-source PHP projects.  
I also love to contribute to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1427138/alessandro-minoccheri) where my reputation is growing daily (actually near 24.000)!  


You can contact me at my email address, alessandro.minoccheri@gmail.com or else you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/minompi) or [GitHub](https://github.com/AlessandroMinoccheri).
